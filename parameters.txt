All parameters in Lennard-Jones coordinates:

NVE (microcanonical) ensemble

time step = 0.0001, number of particles = 1000, number of steps = 10000
rho = 0.8, T ~= 1

For radial distribution and velocity autocorrelation:

NVT (Canonical) ensemble

number of particles = 1000, number of steps = 10000
time step = 0.0001 for RDF , time step = 0.005 for VACF

Gas:
rho = 0.4, T_thermostat = 1

Liquid:
rho = 0.8, T_thermostat = 1

Solid:
rho = 3, T_thermostat = 0.5
